My research interests are broadly in the areas of:

* **Inference from relational data:** Multidimensional scaling, embedding methods for graphs, network data analysis, differential privacy

* **Topological Data Analysis:** Statistical behavior of Betti numbers, statistical inference from topological summaries, robust topological inference

* **Statistical Learning Theory:** Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in probability and statistics

* **Probabilistic Methods:** Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, generative models

The following is a list of my publications and preprints.
