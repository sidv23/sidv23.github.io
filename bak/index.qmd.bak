I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](http://stat.psu.edu/) at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Bharath Sriperumbudur](http://personal.psu.edu/bks18/). I am also a research assistant with the [Statistical Consulting Center](https://scc.stat.psu.edu/) at Penn State.

Prior to joining Penn State, I worked as a quantitative researcher at Goldman Sachs from 2016 to 2017, and as a model validation quant at Nomura from 2015 to 2016. I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) with an M.Sc.(Integrated) in Mathematics and Statistics under the supervision of [Dr. Debasis Kundu](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~kundu/kundu.html).


My research interests are broadly in the areas of:

* **Topological Data Analysis:** Statistical behavior of Betti numbers, statistical inference from topological summaries, robust topological inference

* **Statistical Learning Theory:** Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in probability and statistics, differential privacy

* **Probabilistic Methods:** Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, generative models
