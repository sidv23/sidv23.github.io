<!-- My interest in research has been cultivated and nurtured by inspirational teachers, and my own teaching philosophy has been molded, and has evolved, to reflect these experiences.  -->
<!-- As an educator, my aim is to provide students with the ability to understand the theoretical underpinnings in statistical reasoning and to apply these methods using computing, quantitative analyses, and data science.  -->
Here's a list of all the courses I've had the pleasure of teaching over the years. Course materials are available upon request.
